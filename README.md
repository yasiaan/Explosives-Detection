# Explosives-Detection
An Artificial Intelligence Model for Explosives Detection

Hidden explosives detection is a priority for defence and security for every country as search
by humans or dogs is not a good situation as the technology used in explosives is very
advanced. In this project, the aim is to design an electronic nose to detect the explosives
which will be accurate, reliable, fast, simple and small using data mining techniques. This
is a classification problem, for detection of explosives along with deep learning algorithms
like LSTM and this project develops the machine learning algorithms to evaluate the
proposed work. The proposed work is implemented using software platforms such as
Anaconda (Python), Sklearn and Keras. The main objective of proposed work is four
folded: 1) Understanding the basic idea of which chemicals are contributing towards an
explosive nature 2) Use data from different types of sensors to detect 3) Improve the results
of the detection by the sensors.4) Build models using different classification techniques
and LSTM and evaluate the performance. The main aim is to achieve accurate detection
of explosives using a profound LSTM network. So we should understand how LSTM(s)
works with explosives detection, in fact LSTM refers to Long Short Term Memory which
means that the past informations are saved and used for the next steps, for an electronic
nose the human brain distinguishes between smells based on historical smells saved on
the synapses of our brain, as said in the IEEE article : “In these networks a state of what
the network has seen so far is kept and used during the learning process”, Thus, LSTMs
mimic this wonderful natural event, in fact, every time our model finds the same response
from the sensors (detectors), it is the same smell and that is why we substitute the
convolutional process using LSTM cells in order to have a higher precision when treating
time-limited records, the activation functions used are the same as for the convolutional
neural network.
